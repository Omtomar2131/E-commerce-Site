E-commerce Site
Welcome to my e-commerce site project! This site is a work in progress as I continue to learn and develop my web development skills. The project currently features a simple, visually appealing layout with product listings and an "Add to Cart" button.

Features
Product Listings: View products with images, names, and prices.
"Add to Cart" Button: Basic functionality to add items to the cart.
Current Status
Please note that the site is not fully functional at this stage. The shopping cart functionality is not yet implemented, and some features are still under development.

Future Plans
I plan to enhance this site with the following features:

Complete Shopping Cart Functionality: Ability to view and manage cart items.
Checkout Process: Integration of a checkout system.
Improved Design and User Experience: Refinements in layout and interactive elements.
